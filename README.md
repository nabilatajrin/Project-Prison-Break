# Project-Prison-Break

In this project we'll do the following:
1. Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
2. Analyze the data using Python

Specifically, we'll find out the following:
1. In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
2. In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
3. We'll use Python to create this frequency table showing our results:

Country	Number of Occurrences
France	15
United States	8
Belgium	4
Canada	4
Greece	4
Australia	2
Brazil	2
United Kingdom	2
Mexico	1
Ireland	1
Italy	1
Puerto Rico	1
Chile	1
